This is a project were we are working on making an improved platform for the schnapsen card game.
It is not currently in a shape such that it can be used for the course.


If you want to use the platform to implement your own bots, run

```bash
pip install .
```

To get started, and be able to edit the code run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

what we would like to be able to do:

```bash
python executables/main.py load-schnapsen-bot --bot="prins.my_bot_copy.my_rand 1000 5"  --bot="prins.my_bot.rand 1000 5"
```
